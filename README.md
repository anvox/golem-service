# Golem service

Manage services run on AWS

# Require arguments

Golem service commands perform on an specific service on an environment. That's why argument `-e`/`--environment` and `-t`/`--stack` are required. This is the same convention from `golem-tf`.<br/>
Further, `-s`/`--service` is required for commands need to perform on specific service in stack. 

# Install

For now, the only way to install `golem-service` is from source code. Pull and run `make build`. Then run from repo root directory.
